# Dayflare's Garry's Mod Dump

**NOTICE**

I will not be removing anything from this repository. If you are someone who is currently using my work for your Garry's Mod servers and wish for anything to be private for your own personal use, do not bother me about it. Make your own images. (i.e "Ordinance" logo)

**Information**

As of March 2025, I have deleted Garry's Mod from my Steam library and am no longer active in the game and the community. This repository acts as the mastery dump of all the frameworks, gamemodes, schemas, and images that I have collected over the years. What I have not included is addons, maps, and server content because that would make this repository to be around 100GB. You are free to use any of this however you want, it does not matter to me. Whatever is in this repository is what it is, it does not effect me and I do not care. I will provide zero support.
