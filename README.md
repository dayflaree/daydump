# Dayflare's Garry's Mod Dump

**Information**

As of March 2025, I have deleted Garry's Mod from my Steam library and am no longer active in the game and the community. This repository acts as the mastery dump of all the frameworks, gamemodes, schemas, addons, server content etc that I have collected over the years. You are free to use any of it however you want, it does not matter to me. Whatever is in this repository is what it is, it does not effect me and I do not care.
