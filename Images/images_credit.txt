Dayflare speaking here!

I designed and made 90% of these images, regardless of what others may claim. The only images I didn't design are Terminal Networks "tn_logo.png" and the "Picsart.webp" images as well as some of the images in Project 5K.
Everything else was designed and made by me, Dayflare.
